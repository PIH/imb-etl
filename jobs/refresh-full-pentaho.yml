# Currently we have this configured as a job pipeline, with 1 max concurrent job (eg. execute each job in serial)
# If we have the server resources, and want to reduce loading time, we could adapt this to use a nested iterating-job
# that would execute the upper-neno and lower-neno refreshes concurrently.

# If you wish to execute the job on a different schedule, you can adjust that here
